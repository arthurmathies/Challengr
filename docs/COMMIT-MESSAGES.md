#The Art of Commit Messages

  There is a strict style and format that we use for our commit messages at **Challengr**. If your commit messages are not clear and concise your Pull Request will not be merged.

####The Layout

  [type] : \<subject>

  \<body>

  \<footer> 
  
####Allowed Values for \<type>

  - feat (new feature)
  - fix (bug fix)
  - docs (changes to documentation)
  - style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
  - refactor (refactoring production code)
  - test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
  - chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
  - library (adding any kind of dependencies or library code to production code)

####Subject

  Use an imperative tone for your commit messages conveying what a commit does, rather than what it did. Ex. **change** rather than **changed** or **changes**

  Example:
    
    [docs]: add README.md
    [refactor]: remove unused container element
  
####The Body
  The body, just like the subject, should use an imperative tone. You do not necessarily have to use the body, but you may if you think it further clears your point. Add a body like this

    git commit -m "Subject" -m "Body"
